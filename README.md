# OpenMJ : Open Source Mahjong Library

The aim of this project is to build a user-friendly high-performance library of applications for all things mahjong. We should attempt to cover multiple mahjong varients starting from the various rulesets of riichi mahjong.

### Current Vision

Currently, I would like to have at least the following features:
- High-performance core library to deal with basic things like tiles and scoring.
- Online multiplayer game where the host can select which variants (i.e. red dora, kan dora, Washizu, starting points, etc.) with the choice of running a server capable of hosting multiple games simultaneously.
- 2D and 3D GUI clients for playing the games (likely with OpenGL + ImGUI).
- Mathematical or Monte-Carlo simulators that can help analyze different situations that can arise in a game (similar to the various poker solvers). Should have a user-friendly 2D GUI.

I really wish to have the following (long term):
- VR client.
- High-performance python wrapper for machine learning, particularly for training different reinforcement learning agents.

### Usage

The project is currently very WIP, but the instructions for using each component will be linked here as they get closer to completion.

### Contributing

If you have any ideas or performance improvements for any of the currently developed algorithms, I really appreciate it if you can contribute. Also, please read the [contributing instructions](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
